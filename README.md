# drag-and-drop-items

In this project, I demonstrate a website that features a drag and drop functionality created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design includes two boxes where users can easily drag items from one box to another. The interface is user-friendly and visually appealing, showcasing a clean layout achieved through custom styling. Whether you're moving items back and forth or organizing content, this simple yet effective drag and drop feature enhances the user experience on the site.
